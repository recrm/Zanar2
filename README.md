#Zanar2

This is my first ever attempt at making a game. I'm quite proud of it 
actually; however, it is rough, hard to read, and needs to be rewritten 
from the ground up. Beyond minor bug fixes, there will not be any 
changes. It is what it is.

###Requirements:

python3<br />
pygame<br />
(http://www.pygame.org/news.html)

###Controls:

Arrow keys - Control all cursers.<br />
Enter - Makes selection.<br />
Exit - Cancel selection.<br />
q - Enter into and exit out of equipment menu.

Everything else is accessible through trial and error.

###Credits

Troy Chartier - Music<br />
Ryan Chartier - Everything else

I plan on continuing development of the main engine here.
