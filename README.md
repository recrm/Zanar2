This is my first ever attempt at making a game. I'm quite proud of it 
actually; however, it is rough, hard to read, and needs to be rewritten 
from the ground up. Beyond minor bug fixes, there will not be any 
changes. It is what it is.

Requirements:
=============

python3
pygame
(http://www.pygame.org/news.html)

Controls:
=========

Arrow keys - Control all cursers.
Enter - Makes selection.
Exit - Cancel selection.
q - Enter into and exit out of equipment menu.

Everything else is accessible through trial and error.

I plan on continuing development of the main engine here.
